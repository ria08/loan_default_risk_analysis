# loan_default_risk_analysis
<br>This case study uses EDA to identify which customers can potentially repay the loans versus the ones who are more likely to be defaulters.  It focuses on the basics of risk analytics in banking and financial services as well as understanding how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers. </br>
<h1>Business Understanding:</h1>
<br>Loan providers face challenges in offering loans to customers with insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Some consumers exploit this by defaulting on their payments. Consumer finance companies specializing in lending various types of loans to customers aim to address this issue by using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in the data. This approach ensures that applicants capable of repaying loans are not unfairly rejected.</br>
<br>When a company receives a loan application, decisions regarding approval are made based on the applicant's profile. Two types of risks are associated with this process:</br>
<br>If an applicant is likely to repay the loan, denying approval results in lost business for the company.</br>
<br>If an applicant is likely to default, approving the loan can lead to financial losses.</br>
<br>The provided data contains information about loan applications at the time of submission and highlights two scenarios:</br>
<br><b>Clients with payment difficulties:<b> Those with delayed payments exceeding X days in at least one of the first Y installments in the sample.</br>
<br><b>All other cases:<b> Instances where payments were made on time.</br>
<br>When a client applies for a loan, there are four potential outcomes:</br>
<br><b>Approved:</b> The company approves the loan application.</br>
<br><b>Cancelled:</b> The client cancels the application during the approval process due to changed intentions or unfavorable pricing.</br>
<br><b>Refused:</b> The company rejects the loan application, often because the applicant fails to meet requirements.</br>
<br><b>Unused Offer:</b> The client cancels the loan at various stages of the process</br>
<br>This case study aims to use EDA to analyze how consumer attributes and loan characteristics influence default tendencies, assisting companies in making informed and strategic decisions.</br>
